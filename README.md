In the dev folder there is a progressdemo.

This demonstrates how to use a progresbar using ExtJS 6.5.0.

For the sake of expediency the only class which matters is located under dev/progressdemo/app/view/main/Main.js

You can also view a build version running live here:

Click the 'Verify your progress' button to view a popup with a progress bar.
